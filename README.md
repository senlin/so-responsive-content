## Frequently Asked Questions

### I have an issue with this plugin, where can I get support?

This repo is open to _any_ kind of contributions.

## Languages

Naturally the SO Responsive Content plugin has been fully internationalized. In the languages directory you will find the .pot file and the .po file. I already have added the Dutch translation files.

The plugin only contains 38 strings (of which many only 1 word); it would be a awesome if you can help me translate it into other languages!
